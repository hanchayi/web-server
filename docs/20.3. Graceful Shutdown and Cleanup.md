# Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup
正常停机和清理

The code in Listing 20-20 is responding to requests asynchronously through the use of a thread pool, as we intended. We get some warnings about the workers, id, and thread fields that we’re not using in a direct way that reminds us we’re not cleaning up anything. When we use the less elegant ctrl-c method to halt the main thread, all other threads are stopped immediately as well, even if they’re in the middle of serving a request.
如我们所愿，清单20-20中的代码通过使用线程池异步响应请求。
我们得到了一些关于我们没有直接使用的worker、id和thread字段的警告，这提醒我们没有清理任何东西。
当我们使用不那么优雅的ctrl-c方法来停止主线程时，所有其他线程也会立即停止，即使它们正在处理请求。

Next, then, we’ll implement the Drop trait to call join on each of the threads in the pool so they can finish the requests they’re working on before closing. Then we’ll implement a way to tell the threads they should stop accepting new requests and shut down. To see this code in action, we’ll modify our server to accept only two requests before gracefully shutting down its thread pool.
接下来，我们将实现Drop trait来对池中的每个线程调用join，以便它们可以在关闭之前完成正在处理的请求。
然后我们将实现一种方法来告诉线程它们应该停止接受新请求并关闭。
为了看看这段代码的实际效果，我们将修改服务器，使其在优雅地关闭线程池之前只接受两个请求。

## Implementing the Drop Trait on ThreadPool
在ThreadPool上实现Drop特性

Let’s start with implementing Drop on our thread pool. When the pool is dropped, our threads should all join to make sure they finish their work. Listing 20-22 shows a first attempt at a Drop implementation; this code won’t quite work yet.
让我们从在线程池中实现放入操作开始。
当线程池被删除时，我们的线程应该合并以确保它们完成它们的工作。
代码清单20-22是第一次尝试使用Drop实现;这段代码还不能正常工作。

Filename: src/lib.rs

This code does not compile!
``` rust
impl Drop for ThreadPool {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        for worker in &mut self.workers {
            println!("Shutting down worker {}", worker.id);

            worker.thread.join().unwrap();
        }
    }
}
```
Listing 20-22: Joining each thread when the thread pool goes out of scope

First, we loop through each of the thread pool workers. We use &mut for this because self is a mutable reference, and we also need to be able to mutate worker. For each worker, we print a message saying that this particular worker is shutting down, and then we call join on that worker’s thread. If the call to join fails, we use unwrap to make Rust panic and go into an ungraceful shutdown.
首先，我们循环遍历每个线程池工作线程。
我们使用&mut来实现这一点，因为self是一个可变引用，我们还需要能够改变worker。
对于每个worker，我们打印一条消息，指出这个特定的worker将要关闭，然后我们在该worker的线程上调用join。
如果join调用失败，我们使用unwrap使Rust出现错误并进入不优雅的关闭。

Here is the error we get when we compile this code:
```
$ cargo check
    Checking hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
error[E0507]: cannot move out of `worker.thread` which is behind a mutable reference
    --> src/lib.rs:52:13
     |
52   |             worker.thread.join().unwrap();
     |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ------ `worker.thread` moved due to this method call
     |             |
     |             move occurs because `worker.thread` has type `JoinHandle<()>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
     |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `worker.thread`
```

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0507`.
error: could not compile `hello` due to previous error
The error tells us we can’t call join because we only have a mutable borrow of each worker and join takes ownership of its argument. To solve this issue, we need to move the thread out of the Worker instance that owns thread so join can consume the thread. We did this in Listing 17-15: if Worker holds an Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>> instead, we can call the take method on the Option to move the value out of the Some variant and leave a None variant in its place. In other words, a Worker that is running will have a Some variant in thread, and when we want to clean up a Worker, we’ll replace Some with None so the Worker doesn’t have a thread to run.
错误告诉我们不能调用join，因为我们只有每个worker的可变借用，并且join拥有它的参数。
为了解决这个问题，我们需要将线程移出拥有thread的Worker实例，以便join可以消耗线程。
我们在代码清单17-15中这样做了:如果Worker持有一个Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>>，我们可以调用Option的take方法，将值移出某个变体，并在其位置留下一个None变体。
换句话说，一个正在运行的Worker将在线程中有一些变体，当我们想要清理一个Worker时，我们将用None替换一些，这样Worker就没有线程运行了。

So we know we want to update the definition of Worker like this:
所以我们需要像下面这样更新Worker的定义:

Filename: src/lib.rs

This code does not compile!
struct Worker {
    id: usize,
    thread: Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>>,
}
Now let’s lean on the compiler to find the other places that need to change. Checking this code, we get two errors:

```
$ cargo check
    Checking hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)

error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/lib.rs:72:22

```

Some errors have detailed explanations: E0308, E0599.
For more information about an error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `hello` due to 2 previous errors
Let’s address the second error, which points to the code at the end of Worker::new; we need to wrap the thread value in Some when we create a new Worker. Make the following changes to fix this error:
让我们解决第二个错误，它指向Worker::new末尾的代码;
当我们创建一个新的Worker时，我们需要将thread的值包裹在其中。做以下修改来修复这个错误:

Filename: src/lib.rs

This code does not compile!
``` rust
impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Job>>>) -> Worker {
        // --snip--

        Worker {
            id,
            thread: Some(thread),
        }
    }
}
```
The first error is in our Drop implementation. We mentioned earlier that we intended to call take on the Option value to move thread out of worker. The following changes will do so:

Filename: src/lib.rs

This code does not produce the desired behavior.
``` rust
impl Drop for ThreadPool {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        for worker in &mut self.workers {
            println!("Shutting down worker {}", worker.id);

            if let Some(thread) = worker.thread.take() {
                thread.join().unwrap();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As discussed in Chapter 17, the take method on Option takes the Some variant out and leaves None in its place. We’re using if let to destructure the Some and get the thread; then we call join on the thread. If a worker’s thread is already None, we know that worker has already had its thread cleaned up, so nothing happens in that case.
如第17章所述，Option的take方法会取出Some变体，不留下任何值。我们使用if let来解构Some并获取线程;然后我们在线程上调用join。
如果一个worker的线程已经是None，我们知道worker已经清理了它的线程，所以在这种情况下什么都不会发生。

## Signaling to the Threads to Stop Listening for Jobs
向线程发送停止监听作业的信号 

With all the changes we’ve made, our code compiles without any warnings. However, the bad news is this code doesn’t function the way we want it to yet. The key is the logic in the closures run by the threads of the Worker instances: at the moment, we call join, but that won’t shut down the threads because they loop forever looking for jobs. If we try to drop our ThreadPool with our current implementation of drop, the main thread will block forever waiting for the first thread to finish.
使用我们所做的所有更改，我们的代码在编译时不会出现任何警告。然而，坏消息是这段代码还没有按照我们希望的方式运行。
关键在于由工作线程实例运行的闭包中的逻辑:目前，我们调用了join，但这不会关闭线程，因为它们永远在循环寻找作业。
如果我们尝试用当前的drop实现来删除我们的线程池，主线程将永远阻塞，等待第一个线程完成。

To fix this problem, we’ll need a change in the ThreadPool drop implementation and then a change in the Worker loop.
为了解决这个问题，我们需要修改ThreadPool的drop实现，然后修改Worker循环。

First, we’ll change the ThreadPool drop implementation to explicitly drop the sender before waiting for the threads to finish. Listing 20-23 shows the changes to ThreadPool to explicitly drop sender. We use the same Option and take technique as we did with the thread to be able to move sender out of ThreadPool:
首先，我们将修改ThreadPool的删除实现，在等待线程完成之前显式地删除发送方。
清单20-23显示了为显式删除sender而对ThreadPool所做的更改。
我们使用与处理线程相同的选项和技术，以便能够将sender移出线程池:

Filename: src/lib.rs

This code does not produce the desired behavior.
``` rust
pub struct ThreadPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
    sender: Option<mpsc::Sender<Job>>,
}
// --snip--
impl ThreadPool {
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> ThreadPool {
        // --snip--

        ThreadPool {
            workers,
            sender: Some(sender),
        }
    }

    pub fn execute<F>(&self, f: F)
    where
        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,
    {
        let job = Box::new(f);

        self.sender.as_ref().unwrap().send(job).unwrap();
    }
}

impl Drop for ThreadPool {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        drop(self.sender.take());

        for worker in &mut self.workers {
            println!("Shutting down worker {}", worker.id);

            if let Some(thread) = worker.thread.take() {
                thread.join().unwrap();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Listing 20-23: Explicitly drop sender before joining the worker threads

Dropping sender closes the channel, which indicates no more messages will be sent. When that happens, all the calls to recv that the workers do in the infinite loop will return an error. In Listing 20-24, we change the Worker loop to gracefully exit the loop in that case, which means the threads will finish when the ThreadPool drop implementation calls join on them.
丢弃发送者关闭通道，这表示将不再发送消息。
当这种情况发生时，所有worker在无限循环中对recv的调用都会返回错误。
在清单20-24中，我们修改了工作循环，以便在这种情况下优雅地退出循环，这意味着当ThreadPool放弃对线程的join实现调用时，线程将结束。

Filename: src/lib.rs
``` rust
impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Job>>>) -> Worker {
        let thread = thread::spawn(move || loop {
            let message = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv();

            match message {
                Ok(job) => {
                    println!("Worker {id} got a job; executing.");

                    job();
                }
                Err(_) => {
                    println!("Worker {id} disconnected; shutting down.");
                    break;
                }
            }
        });

        Worker {
            id,
            thread: Some(thread),
        }
    }
}
```
Listing 20-24: Explicitly break out of the loop when recv returns an error

To see this code in action, let’s modify main to accept only two requests before gracefully shutting down the server, as shown in Listing 20-25.
为了看看这段代码的实际效果，让我们修改main，让它在优雅地关闭服务器之前只接受两个请求，如清单20-25所示。

Filename: src/main.rs
``` rust
fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878").unwrap();
    let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);

    for stream in listener.incoming().take(2) {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        pool.execute(|| {
            handle_connection(stream);
        });
    }

    println!("Shutting down.");
}
```
Listing 20-25: Shut down the server after serving two requests by exiting the loop

You wouldn’t want a real-world web server to shut down after serving only two requests. This code just demonstrates that the graceful shutdown and cleanup is in working order.
你肯定不希望现实世界的web服务器在仅提供两个请求后就关闭。这段代码只是证明了安全关闭和清理工作正常。

The take method is defined in the Iterator trait and limits the iteration to the first two items at most. The ThreadPool will go out of scope at the end of main, and the drop implementation will run.
take方法定义在Iterator trait中，它将迭代限制在最多前两项。线程池会在main结束时超出作用域，drop实现会运行。

Start the server with cargo run, and make three requests. The third request should error, and in your terminal you should see output similar to this:
运行cargo启动服务器，并发出三个请求。
第三个请求应该会报错，在终端中会看到类似下面的输出:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.0s
     Running `target/debug/hello`
Worker 0 got a job; executing.
Shutting down.
Shutting down worker 0
Worker 3 got a job; executing.
Worker 1 disconnected; shutting down.
Worker 2 disconnected; shutting down.
Worker 3 disconnected; shutting down.
Worker 0 disconnected; shutting down.
Shutting down worker 1
Shutting down worker 2
Shutting down worker 3
```

You might see a different ordering of workers and messages printed. We can see how this code works from the messages: workers 0 and 3 got the first two requests. The server stopped accepting connections after the second connection, and the Drop implementation on ThreadPool starts executing before worker 3 even starts its job. Dropping the sender disconnects all the workers and tells them to shut down. The workers each print a message when they disconnect, and then the thread pool calls join to wait for each worker thread to finish.
你可能会看到不同顺序的worker和打印的消息。
我们可以从消息中看到这段代码是如何工作的:worker 0和3收到了前两个请求。
服务器在第二次连接之后就停止接受连接了，而且在worker 3开始工作之前，ThreadPool上的Drop实现就开始执行了。删除发送者会断开所有工作程序的连接，并告诉它们关闭。每个工作线程在断开连接时都会打印一条消息，然后线程池调用join来等待每个工作线程完成。

Notice one interesting aspect of this particular execution: the ThreadPool dropped the sender, and before any worker received an error, we tried to join worker 0. Worker 0 had not yet gotten an error from recv, so the main thread blocked waiting for worker 0 to finish. In the meantime, worker 3 received a job and then all threads received an error. When worker 0 finished, the main thread waited for the rest of the workers to finish. At that point, they had all exited their loops and stopped.

Congrats! We’ve now completed our project; we have a basic web server that uses a thread pool to respond asynchronously. We’re able to perform a graceful shutdown of the server, which cleans up all the threads in the pool.

        });
    }

    println!("Shutting down.");

We could do more here! If you want to continue enhancing this project, here are some ideas:

Add more documentation to ThreadPool and its public methods.
为ThreadPool及其公共方法添加更多文档。
Add tests of the library’s functionality.
添加对库功能的测试。
Change calls to unwrap to more robust error handling.
将unwrap调用更改为更健壮的错误处理。
Use ThreadPool to perform some task other than serving web requests.
使用ThreadPool来执行一些任务，而不是服务web请求。
Find a thread pool crate on crates.io and implement a similar web server using the crate instead. 
在板条箱上找到一个线程池。IO并使用crate实现一个类似的web服务器。
Then compare its API and robustness to the thread pool we implemented.
然后将其API和健壮性与我们实现的线程池进行比较。
