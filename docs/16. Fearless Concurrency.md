# Fearless Concurrency
无所畏惧的并发性

Handling concurrent programming safely and efficiently is another of Rust’s major goals. Concurrent programming, where different parts of a program execute independently, and parallel programming, where different parts of a program execute at the same time, are becoming increasingly important as more computers take advantage of their multiple processors. Historically, programming in these contexts has been difficult and error prone: Rust hopes to change that.
安全有效地处理并发编程是Rust的另一个主要目标。
并发编程(程序的不同部分独立执行)和并行编程(程序的不同部分同时执行)正变得越来越重要，因为越来越多的计算机利用了它们的多处理器。
从历史上看，在这些环境中编程是困难的，并且容易出错:Rust希望改变这一点。

Initially, the Rust team thought that ensuring memory safety and preventing concurrency problems were two separate challenges to be solved with different methods. Over time, the team discovered that the ownership and type systems are a powerful set of tools to help manage memory safety and concurrency problems! By leveraging ownership and type checking, many concurrency errors are compile-time errors in Rust rather than runtime errors. Therefore, rather than making you spend lots of time trying to reproduce the exact circumstances under which a runtime concurrency bug occurs, incorrect code will refuse to compile and present an error explaining the problem. As a result, you can fix your code while you’re working on it rather than potentially after it has been shipped to production. We’ve nicknamed this aspect of Rust fearless concurrency. Fearless concurrency allows you to write code that is free of subtle bugs and is easy to refactor without introducing new bugs.
最初，Rust团队认为确保内存安全和防止并发问题是两个独立的挑战，需要用不同的方法来解决。
随着时间的推移，团队发现所有权和类型系统是一组帮助管理内存安全和并发性问题的强大工具!
通过利用所有权和类型检查，Rust中的许多并发错误都是编译时错误，而不是运行时错误。因此，错误的代码将拒绝编译并给出一个解释问题的错误，而不是让您花费大量时间试图重现运行时并发错误发生的确切情况。
因此，您可以在处理代码时进行修复，而不是在代码交付生产后进行修复。我们将Rust的这方面戏称为无所畏惧的并发。无所畏惧的并发性允许您编写没有细微bug的代码，并且易于重构，而不会引入新的bug。

Note: For simplicity’s sake, we’ll refer to many of the problems as concurrent rather than being more precise by saying concurrent and/or parallel. If this book were about concurrency and/or parallelism, we’d be more specific. For this chapter, please mentally substitute concurrent and/or parallel whenever we use concurrent.
注意:为了简单起见，我们将许多问题称为并发的，而不是更精确地说并发和/或并行。
如果这本书是关于并发性和/或并行性的，我们会更具体一些。在本章中，当我们使用concurrent时，请在心里替换concurrent和/或parallel。

Many languages are dogmatic about the solutions they offer for handling concurrent problems. For example, Erlang has elegant functionality for message-passing concurrency but has only obscure ways to share state between threads. Supporting only a subset of possible solutions is a reasonable strategy for higher-level languages, because a higher-level language promises benefits from giving up some control to gain abstractions. However, lower-level languages are expected to provide the solution with the best performance in any given situation and have fewer abstractions over the hardware. Therefore, Rust offers a variety of tools for modeling problems in whatever way is appropriate for your situation and requirements.
许多语言对于它们为处理并发问题提供的解决方案都是教条的。
例如，Erlang具有良好的消息传递并发性功能，但在线程之间共享状态的方法却很模糊。
对于高级语言来说，只支持可能的解决方案的一个子集是一个合理的策略，因为高级语言可以从放弃一些控制来获得抽象中获益。
然而，低级语言被期望在任何给定的情况下提供最佳性能的解决方案，并且在硬件上具有更少的抽象。
因此，Rust提供了各种各样的工具，以任何适合您的情况和需求的方式对问题进行建模。
